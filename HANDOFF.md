# Handoff

## 2026-09-07 - Package and publish handoff skill (owner: Codex)

State:

- [x] In progress
- [x] Completed

Steps:

- [x] Package the supplied skill and its supporting resources in `skills/handoff/`.
- [x] Add public documentation, license, CI, and a reproducible release archive.
- [x] Verify helper behavior and package contents.
- [x] Commit and publish the new GitHub repository; record the result.

Status: Complete. Published commit `143adaf` to https://github.com/divijshrivastava/handoff-skill (public, main). Five helper tests and two packaging tests pass locally and in GitHub CI on Python 3.9 and 3.12 (run 34070412714). The skill-creator validator passes using an isolated PyYAML environment. Both archives build reproducibly and the extracted helper runs. The public installer lists exactly one skill, `handoff`. No installed skills were replaced. Release automation is ready; no version tag or GitHub release was requested or created. No remaining implementation work.
